I am Trevor Tuttle, a first year Data Science Master's student. I first took this course two years ago with Professor Albuyeh, and have since been a teaching assistant for both fall and winter quarters this academic year. I enjoy hiking, video games, and most of all learning! My academic interests lie in machine learning systems, scalability, and optimization.
