I am Sai, a first year CSE Masterâ€™s student. My academic interests lie primarily in machine learning and data analytics. I have previously interned as a machine learning applied scientist at Amazon and as a software engineer at Oracle. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, running and listening to music.
