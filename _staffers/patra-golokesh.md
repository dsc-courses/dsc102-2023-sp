My name is Golokesh Patra, a first-year Data Science Master's student. With over 4 years of work experience as a Senior Data Engineer at HP Inc and Thoughtworks, I have gained valuable insights into data analytics. I have also served as a teaching assistant for the same course during the Winter Quarter of this academic year, which has further honed my skills in this domain. My academic interests primarily lie in Machine Learning and Scalable Data Analytics.
