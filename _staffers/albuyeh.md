Hi there, my name is Rod. I was born and raised in the Bay Area and have spent my entire academic and professional life in various parts of California, including Mountain View, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and now San Diego. I obtained my PhD in 2016 from USC, where I studied political belief systems. After completing my doctoral degree, I worked in machine learning and architecture roles at both large companies such as Intuit and ResMed, as well as smaller FinTech startups such as Figure and Oportun. Currently, I run a machine learning consultancy and assist companies with scaling, automating, and productionizing their workloads. Additionally, I have a passion for teaching and am returning to UCSD after a brief stint during the pandemic. Outside of data science, I am an avid (and sometimes competitive) mixed martial artist, musician, tinkerer, and dad. I also have a cat named Foosball and a dog named Lola.

I am excited about the content we will be covering in this course because it is foundational to systems you will be using in your career, whether you are working in "lift and churn" business applications or the next LLM. The tools you learn here will serve you for the long haul.
